# YouTube Transcript Extraction

This is a startup project to support transcoding YouTube videos for use in LLM applications.  Aside from PyTybe, which can be a bit combersome in its retrieval of captions, this library seems to be more consitant and consise.  The initial code was genearated by AI and works quite well after youtube-transcript-api (https://pypi.org/project/youtube-transcript-api/) is installed via 

```

pip install youtube-transcript-api

```

Future work may build on and bring some LLM work into this project, or this may serve as a barebones reference.  I'm not sure yet.
